Lit -- tle child, the Sav -- iour loved you,
So He left His home on high;
Came on earth a low -- ly stran -- ger,
For your sins to bleed and die.
Sin had set its stamp up -- on you,
And must shut you out from God;
Je -- sus came to make a -- tone -- ment,
Tho’ it cost His pre -- cious blood.

Lit -- tle child, the bless -- ed Sav -- iour
Wick -- ed men de -- spised and slew,
On the cru -- el cross they nailed Him,
With a spear they pierced Him, too.
“It is fin -- ished!” said the Sav -- iour;
Well He knew His work was done;

He, God’s ho -- ly, spot -- less Son.

All cre -- a -- tion stood in won -- der

Rocks and hills were rent a -- sun -- der
When the Lord was cru -- ci -- fied.

Killed the Lord of life and glo -- ry,
Killed the Christ, God’s much -- loved Son.

Lit -- tle child, death could not hold Him,
So the grave gave up its prey;
Straight in -- to the heavens He en -- tered,
\italicsOn Thence \italicsOff He speaks to you to -- day.
Yes, His lov -- ing eye is on you,
He from sin would set you free,
Thus He speaks of lit -- tle chil -- dren,
“Suf -- fer them to come to Me.”
