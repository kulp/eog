The {\textit{}Echoes of Grace Hymn Book} is a collection of songs selected for
use in gospel work with adults and children as well as for the enjoyment and
profit of believers who wish to sing together unto the Lord.

For convenient reference, the gospel hymns have been placed in the front of the
book, those for believers in the center and those for children toward the end.
At the back of the book you will find several indexes to help you find and
choose specific hymns.

This edition conforms textually to the 1998 edition, with a few exceptions
where it conforms to the 1951 edition for grammatical reasons. Poet and
composer attributions were corrected and clarified in some cases.

We believe that all the hymns contained in this edition are now in the public
domain.

We take our place with the original editors of this hymn book who said: ``A
work undertaken in the consciousness of human insufficiency, but with
confidence in the Lord's enabling grace for every task, is thus committed to
Him for His gracious blessing and in service to His beloved saints at large.''
